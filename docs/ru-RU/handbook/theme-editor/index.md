# Theme Editor

> Note: The current theme feature is implemented based on antd 5.x version. It is recommended to read about the [Customizing Theme](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#%E8%87%AA%E5%AE%9A%E4%B9%89%E4%B8%BB%E9%A2%98) concept before proceeding with this document.

## Introduction

The plugin is essentially a tool for modifying the style of the entire front-end page. It currently supports editing global [SeedToken](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#seedtoken), [MapToken](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#maptoken), and [AliasToken](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#aliastoken), as well as enabling a [switch](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E9%A2%84%E8%AE%BE%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95) to Dark Mode and Compact Mode. In the future, it may support [component-level](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#%E4%BF%AE%E6%94%B9%E7%BB%84%E4%BB%B6%E5%8F%98%E9%87%8F-component-token) theme customization.

## User Options for Theme Switching

Newly added themes are by default available for users to switch to. If you do not want users to switch to a certain theme, you can turn off the `User selectable` switch at the bottom right of the theme card, making it unavailable for users to choose.

## Setting as Default Theme (The Default Theme Cannot Be Deleted)

Initially, the `Default Theme` is set as the default. If you want to set a specific theme as the new default, switch on the `Default Theme` toggle at the bottom right of the card. This will ensure that when users open the page for the first time, they will be presented with this theme.
