# Block

Blocks are carriers of data and content. They can be placed in a Page, a Modal dialog, or a Drawer, and multiple blocks can be freely dragged and arranged.

## Block Types

- Data Blocks: Used to display data from the data sources on the interface.
- Filter Blocks: Used to use data from the data sources as filtering criteria for other data blocks.
- Other Blocks: Used to contain specific or independent content such as workflow tasks, audit logs, Markdown, etc.

## Adding Blocks

Blocks can be placed in a Page, Modal dialog, or Drawer.

### Blocks in a Page

Currently, the types of blocks in a page include: Data Blocks, Filter Blocks, and Other Blocks.

### Blocks in a Popup (Modal or Drawer)

Popups come in two forms: Modals and Drawers, and, like pages, can also have blocks added to them. The difference is that blocks in popups are generally used for adding, editing, or viewing individual records. The types of blocks include Data Blocks and Other Blocks.

## Block Designer

Every block has three small icons in the upper right corner, from left to right they are:

1. Drag Layout
2. Quick Add Block
3. Block Configuration

Simple blocks have all their configuration items concentrated in "Block Configuration," such as Markdown.

Complex data type blocks will also provide separate embedded "Configure Fields" and "Configure Actions".

Besides, there is also the potential for more nested possibilities, such as Chart Blocks.
