# Actions

In the UI, Actions are represented by buttons that trigger specific commands. These buttons can be directly placed on pages, within dialogs, or inside drawers, and they can also be combined with blocks. The current dynamic configuration options for Actions are primarily used when combined with blocks.

#### Actions within Blocks

#### Operation Designer (Toolbar)

Unlike blocks and fields, the operation designer features only two icons:
- Drag
- Configuration actions

#### Operation Drag-and-Drop Sorting

To reorder buttons, simply hold down the "Drag" icon in the button designer and rearrange the buttons as needed.
