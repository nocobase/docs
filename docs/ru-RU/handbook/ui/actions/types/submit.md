1. Insert and create new records directly;
2. Insert only if the record doesn't exist (requires fields to determine the recordâ€™s existence);
3. Insert if the record doesn't exist, otherwise update (requires fields to check for existing records).

### Bind Workflows

The bound workflow will only be triggered once the data has been successfully submitted.
