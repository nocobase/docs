# Save Record

### Introduction

The save data operation enables assigning values to fields through field assignment, which takes precedence over any values entered in the form. This operation can be paired with workflows to automate data processes seamlessly.

### Operation Configuration Items

#### Assign Field Values

When field assignment is configured, the assigned value will override any input provided in the form for the same field, ensuring consistency and priority for the predefined value.
