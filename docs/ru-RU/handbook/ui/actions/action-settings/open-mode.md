# Open Mode

## Introduction

There are two ways to open a popup: using a drawer or dialog, with the drawer being the default. Drawers are ideal for managing large amounts of information and complex operations, while dialog boxes are better suited for straightforward content or quick actions. The popup can be closed by clicking on the overlay.
