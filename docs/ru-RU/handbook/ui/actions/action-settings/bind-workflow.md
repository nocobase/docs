# Bind Workflows

## Introduction

Binding a workflow is a powerful way to automate data processing. By linking an operation to a workflow, you ensure that data flows seamlessly through business processes. Itâ€™s important to note that workflows are triggered only after a successful data submission; if the operation fails, the workflow will not be activated.

The following operation buttons currently support workflow binding:

"Submit" and "Save" buttons for new forms.

"Submit" and "Save" buttons for update forms.

"Update Data" button in data rows (including tables, lists, kanban, etc.).
