# Required Fields

## Introduction

"Required" is a fundamental rule in form validation. You can enable it directly within the field settings or dynamically configure it through form linkage rules.

## Static Setting

You can directly designate a field as required, which is ideal for fields that must always be completed by users, such as username and password.

## Dynamic Setting (Conditional Required)

Required fields can be set conditionally using the form block's linkage rules.

Example: The shipping date field becomes required when the order status is marked as "shipped."
