# Fields

In the UI, fields refer to components that serve as carriers for individual data units. Various types of data are represented through different field components. Fields must be attached to blocks and cannot function independently.

## Fields within Blocks

Fields are typically not used in isolation but rather as sub-elements within data-type blocks. These blocks generally include "configured columns," with the list of fields provided by the current data table.

## Field Designer (Toolbar)

Like blocks, field components feature three icons in the upper right corner:

- Drag and Drop Layout
- Quick Add Field
- Field Parameter Configuration

## Field Layout

You can customize the layout of fields within a block by dragging and rearranging them as needed.

## Field Components

Certain fields support switching between different components. For example, the `URL` component can be switched to the `Preview` component.
