# Filter blocks - Form Fields

## Introduction

The filter form allows you to select fields from both the current table and related tables (including fields from associated relationships) to serve as filter criteria.

**Example:** Suppose you want to filter orders using fields from a related table. The order table and the customer table have a one-to-many relationship. In this case, you can configure the customer's name and phone number fields from the customer table as filter criteria to help narrow down the orders.
