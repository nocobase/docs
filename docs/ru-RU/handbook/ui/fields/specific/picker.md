## Introduction

The **Record picker**, presented as a popup table selector, allows users to select existing data associations for the target table or add new data to the target table and then associate it.

The order table features a many-to-many relationship field called "Products".

Data that has already been selected will not appear in the table selector.

Within the table selector, users can further manage the relationship target table (add, delete, import, export, etc.).
