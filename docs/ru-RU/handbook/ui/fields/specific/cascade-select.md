# Cascading Select

## Introduction

The cascading selector is tailored for relational fields where the target table follows a tree structure. It allows users to select data according to the hierarchical levels of the tree, with support for fuzzy search to streamline the selection process.

## Instructions

- For one-to-one relationships, the cascading selector is configured for single selection.

- For one-to-many relationships, the cascading selector enables multi-selection and supports drag-and-drop sorting for more intuitive organization.
