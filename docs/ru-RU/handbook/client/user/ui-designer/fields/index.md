### Fields

In the UI, fields are field components that carry unit data, with different types of data presented by different field components. Fields can only be attached to blocks and cannot be used independently.

#### Fields in Blocks

Fields are generally not used alone but exist as sub-elements of data-type blocks. Data-type blocks typically have a "configure fields" option, and the field list is provided by the current data table.

#### Field Designer (Toolbar)

Like blocks, field components also have three icons in the upper right corner:

- Drag to layout
- Quick add field
- Configure field parameters

#### Field Layout

The layout of fields within a block can be customized by dragging to move them.
