# Actions

In the UI, actions are buttons designed to trigger specific commands. These buttons can be placed directly on the page, within dialogs or drawers, and can also be used in combination with blocks. Currently, dynamic configurations of actions are primarily used in combination with blocks.

## Actions in Blocks

## Action Designer (Toolbar)

Unlike blocks and fields, the action designer only features two icons:

- Drag
- Parameter Configuration

## Action Linkage Rules

Actions with contextual data can also be configured with "Linkage Rules."

Multiple rules can be added, with conditions similar to those used in filtering. These rules can control whether buttons are displayed, hidden, enabled, or disabled.
