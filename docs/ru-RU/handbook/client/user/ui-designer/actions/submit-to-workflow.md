# Submit to Workflow

The Submit to Workflow operation is implemented via plugin extensions.

1. Addition and update forms support the configuration and triggering of submission to workflows.
2. Multiple workflows can be triggered with one button click, each selecting a different workflow and data context (data is not restricted, and users are responsible for ensuring this).
3. Form button triggers only support the new workflow type "Form Event."

For more details, refer to the Plugin Documentation.
