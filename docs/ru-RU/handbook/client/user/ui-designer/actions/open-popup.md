# Open popup

The Open popup operation presents data in a popup window, allowing you to customize detail blocks or form blocks. This feature is suitable for various scenarios. For example, when a data table has many fields, these fields can be divided into different operation blocks, allowing you to focus on viewing or modifying specific fields. You can create multiple customized data display or editing interfaces based on business needs.
