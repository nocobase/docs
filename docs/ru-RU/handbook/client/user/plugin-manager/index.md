# Plugin Manager

The Plugin Manager offers a straightforward and intuitive interface for adding plugins, enhancing NocoBase's functionality with a lightweight and user-friendly experience. It allows for seamless expansion and customization of application features, including the installation, upgrade, and uninstallation of plugins.

**Key Components of the Plugin Manager:**

1. **Local Plugins/Plugin Marketplace**: Access and manage plugins available locally or through the marketplace.
2. **Plugin Classification**: Organize plugins by categories such as Built-in, Enabled, Disabled, and Problematic. The system supports fuzzy search by plugin name.
3. **Add New Plugin**: Easily expand functionality by adding new plugins.
4. **Plugin Configuration Main Body**: Centralize your plugin configurations in one place.
