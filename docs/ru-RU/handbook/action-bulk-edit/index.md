# **Bulk Edit**

## Introduction

The Bulk editing feature is crafted for situations where different update logic must be applied to various groups of records, offering high flexibility in data processing tasks. When the user clicks the batch editing button, a configuration interface appears, enabling the user to define distinct assignment logic for each field. This allows for precise control over how each record is updated based on specific needs.
