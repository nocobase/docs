- Usage - `SP Issuer / EntityID` and `ACS URL` are used to copy and fill in the corresponding configuration in the IdP.

## Field Mapping

Field mapping needs to be configured on the IdP's configuration platform, you can refer to the [example](../auth-saml/example/google.md).

The fields available for mapping in NocoBase are:

- email (required)
- phone (only effective for platforms that support `phone` in scope, such as Alibaba Cloud, Lark)
- nickname
- username
- firstName
- lastName

`nameID` is carried by the SAML protocol and does not need to be mapped, it will be saved as a unique user identifier.
The priority of the new user nickname use rule is: `nickname` > `firstName lastName` > `username` > `nameID`
Currently, user organization and role mapping are not supported.
