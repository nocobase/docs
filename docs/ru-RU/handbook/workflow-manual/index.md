# Overview

<PluginInfo name="workflow-manual" link="/handbook/workflow-manual"></PluginInfo>

When a business process cannot be fully automated, a manual node can be implemented to transfer part of the decision-making authority to a human operator.

Upon reaching a manual node, the process will pause and generate a task for the assigned user. Based on the status selected by the user during submission, the process will either resume, remain on hold, or be terminated. This functionality is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring process approval.

## Installation

This is a built-in plugin, requiring no installation.

## User Manual

The use of manual nodes is divided into two parts:

- [Node Configuration](./node.md)
- [ToDo Block](./block.md)

For further insight into practical applications, you can refer to the [Examples](./example.md) section.
