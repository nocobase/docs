# Bulk update

## Introduction

The bulk update function is designed for situations where you need to apply the same modification across multiple records. Before executing a batch update, users must first define the logic for assigning values to the fields that will be updated. This logic is applied to all selected records once the update button is clicked.

## User Guide

1. Set the Data to Update: Choose between "Selected" or "All," with "Selected" being the default option.
2. Field Assignment: Specify which fields will be included in the batch update; only these specified fields will be affected.

In the example shown, the batch update operation is configured in the waybill table to mark the selected records as "Delivery Confirmed."
