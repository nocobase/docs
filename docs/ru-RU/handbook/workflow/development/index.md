# Overview

While the built-in features of workflows are robust, they may not cover every possible scenario. For instance, the default node types might not accommodate all the operations required in diverse business contexts. To address these gaps, we offer an extension framework for workflows, enabling you to expand trigger types and node functionalities. When the built-in features fall short, these extensions allow you to customize solutions using low-code techniques.

These extensions are categorized into two main areas:

- [Extend Trigger Types](./trigger.md)
- [Extend Node Types](./instruction.md)
