# Overview

<PluginInfo name="workflow-dynamic-calculation" link="/handbook/workflow-dynamic-calculation"></PluginInfo>

Dynamic Calculation nodes stand out from Operator nodes by allowing diverse calculations based on data-associated expressions. While traditional formula fields are limited to applying a single fixed formula across all data rows, Dynamic calculation solve this limitation by enabling workflows to handle different calculation methods for varying data rows.

For example, different product categories in order data may require distinct statistical formulas to compute specific report data.

## Installation

This plugin comes pre-installed and does not require any additional setup.

## User Manual

Using dynamic expressions involves several key sections:

- ["Expression" Template Table](./collection.md)
- [Node](./node.md)

For practical examples, refer to the [Examples](./example.md) section.
