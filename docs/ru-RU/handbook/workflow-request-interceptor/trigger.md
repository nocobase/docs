# Trigger Configuration

## Creating a Trigger

When setting up a workflow, select "Pre-action event" as the event type:

## Selecting the Data Table

The first step in configuring a trigger for intercepting workflows is to select the data table associated with the action:

Next, choose the intercept mode. You can either intercept only the action buttons linked to this workflow or intercept all selected actions for the data table (regardless of the form the action originates from and without needing to bind the corresponding workflow):

Currently, the supported action types include "Create," "Update," and "Delete." You can select multiple action types simultaneously.
