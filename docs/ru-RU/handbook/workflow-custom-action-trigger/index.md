# Overview

<PluginInfo name="workflow-custom-action-trigger" link="/handbook/workflow-custom-action-trigger" commercial="true"></PluginInfo>

NocoBase provides built-in standard data operations like create, read, update, and delete. However, when these operations aren't sufficient to meet complex business requirements, custom action events within workflows can be utilized. These events can be linked to the "Trigger Workflow" button on page blocks, enabling you to perform custom data operations tailored to specific needs.

:::info{title=Note}
The "Custom Action Event" evolved from the "Submit to Workflow" mode found in the "Post-Action Event" feature. As of version `v1.0.0-alpha.7`, it has been separated into its own event and renamed as "Custom Action Event."

## User Manual

Custom action events are used in several key areas:

- [Trigger Configuration](./trigger.md)
- [Action Configuration](./action.md)

For practical examples of how to use these events, refer to the [Examples](./example.md) section.

If integration with an external system is needed, consult the [Http Api](./http-api.md) guide.
