# Overview

<PluginInfo commercial="true" name="workflow-approval" link="/handbook/workflow-approval"></PluginInfo>

Approval processes are tailored specifically for workflows initiated and managed by individuals to determine the status of related data. Commonly employed in office automation and other scenarios requiring human decision-making, these processes include creating and managing workflows such as "Leave Requests," "Expense Reimbursement Approvals," and "Material Procurement Approvals."

The approval plugin offers a dedicated workflow type (trigger) known as "Approval (Event)" and a specialized "Approval" node. When paired with NocoBase's unique custom data tables and blocks, it enables the rapid and flexible creation and management of various approval scenarios.

## User Manual

The approval process is organized into several key sections:

- [Trigger Configuration](./trigger.md)
- [Approval Node Configuration](./node.md)
- [Initiate Approval Configuration](./action.md)
- [Approval Relevant Blocks](./block.md)
- [Workflow task](./tasks.md)

For a deeper dive into these concepts, see [Advanced](./advanced.md).

To invoke this process from an external system, consult [HTTP API](./http-api.md).
