# Initiate Approval Configuration

After configuring and activating an approval workflow, you can link it to the submit button of the relevant data table form. This setup allows users to automatically initiate the approval process when they submit the form:

Once the workflow is linked, users will trigger the approval process upon submitting the form.

The approval initiation button currently only supports the "Submit" (or "Save") button in "Add" or "Update" forms. It does not support the "Submit to Workflow" button (which can only be linked to "Post-action event").
