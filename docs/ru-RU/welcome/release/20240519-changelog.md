### Workflow HTTP Request Node

#### Support for `application/www-x-form-urlencoded` Data Format

Previously, request node only supported JSON format (`application/json`) for the body part of the Content-Type. After the upgrade, it also support configuring form format data in key-value pairs.

#### String Template Support for Value Input Fields

Previously, the value input fields in the "Headers" and "Parameters" sections of request node only supported pure input or variable selection. After the upgrade, you can directly enter a string with embedded variables. It will be automatically parsed as the final string value before sending the request.

### Workflow Custom Action Event

The "Submit to Workflow" action button, originally bound to directly trigger type of the "Post-action Events", has been split and independently created as the "Trigger Workflow" action button for "Custom Action Events" (a commercial plugin). The previously added action buttons in the open-source version can still be used, but no longer supported for new additions. Please use the new "Custom Action Event" instead. See the [Usage Manual](https://docs-cn.nocobase.com/handbook/workflow-custom-action-trigger) for more information.

### Logs

#### Log Plugin File List

Before: In a multi-application environment, the log plugin displays all application log file lists.

After: In a multi-application environment, the log plugin only displays the current application log file list.

#### Workflow and Custom Request Folder Paths

Before: The folder path for workflow and custom request log files is at the same level as the application log folder.

After: The folder path for workflow and custom request log files belongs to the corresponding application log folder.

### Workflow

#### HTTP Request Node Result Data

Previously, the result data structure after successful or failed HTTP request node was inconsistent.

```js
// Only the response data part is returned when successful
{
  // Any JSON content
}

// The failure returns the result of Axios's error.toJSON() function.
{
  config: {},
  headers: {},
  status: 500,
  statusText: 'xxx',
}
```

Now, the response for both success and failure will be stored consistently in the node result.

```js
// Success
{
  config: {},
  headers: {},
  status: 200,
  statusText: 'ok',
  data: {}
}

// Fail
{
  config: {},
  headers: {},
  status: 500,
  statusText: 'xxx',
  data: {}
}
```

Other exceptions such as no response from the server (`status` is `null`), or failed initialization, can be observed in the server logs for error handling.
