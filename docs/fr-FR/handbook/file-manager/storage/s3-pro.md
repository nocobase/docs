# File Storage: S3 (Pro)

<PluginInfo commercial="true" name="file-storage-s3-pro"></PluginInfo>

## Introduction

Building on the file management plugin, this version adds support for file storage types compatible with the S3 protocol. Any object storage service supporting the S3 protocol can be seamlessly integrated, such as Amazon S3, Alibaba Cloud OSS, Tencent Cloud COS, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, etc., enhancing the compatibility and flexibility of storage services.

## Features

1. **Client Upload:** Files are uploaded directly to the storage service without passing through the NocoBase server, enabling a more efficient and faster upload experience.

2. **Private Access:** All file URLs are signed temporary authorization addresses, ensuring secure and time-limited access to files.

## Use Cases

1. **File Table Management:** Centrally manage and store all uploaded files, supporting various file types and storage methods for easy classification and retrieval.

2. **Attachment Field Storage:** Store attachments uploaded via forms or records and associate them with specific data entries.

## Plugin Configuration

1. Enable the `plugin-file-storage-s3-pro` plugin.

2. Navigate to "Setting -> FileManager" to access the file management settings.

3. Click the "Add new" button and select "S3 Pro".

#### Thumbnail Configuration (Optional)

This configuration is optional and should be used when you need to optimize the image preview size or effect. **Please note, this deployment may incur additional costs. For more details, refer to AWS's terms and pricing.**

1. Visit [Dynamic Image Transformation for Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/dynamic-image-transformation-for-amazon-cloudfront/?nc1=h_ls).

2. Click the `Launch in the AWS Console` button at the bottom of the page to start the deployment.
   ![](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250221164214117.png)

3. Follow the prompts to complete the configuration. The following options need special attention:
   1. When creating the stack, you need to specify the Amazon S3 bucket name that contains the source images. Please enter the bucket name you created earlier.
   2. If you chose to deploy the demo UI, after deployment, you can use the UI to test the image processing functionality. In the AWS CloudFormation console, select your stack, go to the "Outputs" tab, find the value corresponding to the `DemoUrl` key, and click the link to open the demo interface.
   3. This solution uses the `sharp` Node.js library for efficient image processing. You can download the source code from the GitHub repository and customize it as needed.

4. Once the configuration is complete, wait for the deployment status to change to `CREATE_COMPLETE`.

5. In the NocoBase configuration, please note the following:
   1. `Thumbnail rule`: Fill in the image processing parameters, such as `?width=100`. For details, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/serverless-image-handler/use-supported-query-param-edits.html).
   2. `Access base URL`: Enter the value from Outputs -> ApiEndpoint after deployment.
   3. `Force path style (access)`: Select **Ignore** (as the bucket name has already been filled in the configuration, no further action is needed during access).
