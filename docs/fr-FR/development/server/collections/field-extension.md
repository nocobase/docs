## Extend Field Type

For example, to extend the password type field ``type: 'password'`

```ts
export class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
  beforeLoad() {
    this.db.registerFieldTypes({
      password: PasswordField,
    });
  }
}

export class PasswordField extends Field {
  get dataType() {
    return DataTypes.STRING;
  }
}
```
