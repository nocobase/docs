## Provider

According to the [Provider Tutorial](/development/client/providers), the Provider has three main functions:

- Providing a globally shared context
- Displaying global content
- Intercepting and rendering based on conditions

For these functions, we offer the following examples:

- [Global Content Display](/plugin-samples/provider/content)
- [Global Context](/plugin-samples/provider/context)
