# @nocobase/cli

The NocoBase CLI is designed to help you develop, build, and deploy NocoBase applications.

<Alert>

NocoBase CLI supports <i>ts-node</i> and <i>node</i> two operation modes.

- ts-node mode (Default): Used for development environment, support real-time compilation, with relatively slow response
- node modeï¼šUsed for production environment, with quick response, but you need to execute `yarn nocobase build` to compile the entire source code first

## Application in Scaffolding

`scripts` in the application scaffolding `package.json` is as below:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nocobase dev",
    "start": "nocobase start",
    "clean": "nocobase clean",
    "build": "nocobase build",
    "test": "nocobase test",
    "pm": "nocobase pm",
    "postinstall": "nocobase postinstall"
  }
}
```

## Command Line Extensions

NocoBase CLI is built based on [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js). You can write the extended commands freely in `app/server/index.ts`:

```ts
const app = new Application(config);

app.command('hello').action(() => {});
```

or in the plugin:

```ts
class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
  beforeLoad() {
    this.app.command('hello').action(() => {});
  }
}
```

Run in the terminal:

```bash
$ yarn nocobase hello
```

## Built-in Commands
