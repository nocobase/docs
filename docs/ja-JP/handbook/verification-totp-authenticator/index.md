:::warning
The plugin does not currently provide a recovery code mechanism. Once the TOTP authenticator is bound, users are advised to keep it secure. If the authenticator is accidentally lost, they can use an alternative verification method to verify their identity, unbind the authenticator, and then rebind it.
:::

## User Unbinding

Unbinding the authenticator requires verification using the already bound verification method.
