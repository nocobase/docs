# Plugin

## Overview

`Plugin` is the plugin class for the NocoBase server, providing configuration properties and lifecycle methods related to server-side plugins.

### Basic Usage

```ts
import { Plugin } from '@nocobase/server';

export class PluginDemoServer extends Plugin {}

export default PluginDemoServer;
```

## Instance Properties

### `options`

Configuration options for the plugin.

### `name`

`string` - The name of the plugin.

### `enabled`

`boolean` - Whether the plugin is enabled.

### `installed`

`boolean` - Whether the plugin is installed.

### `log`

System log instance, with the default `module` set to the plugin name. Refer to [Logger](../logger.md).

### `app`

The `Application` instance of the current application. Refer to [Application](./application.md).

### `pm`

The `PluginManager` instance of the current application. Refer to [PluginManager](./plugin-manager.md).

### `db`

The `DataBase` instance of the current application. Refer to [DataBase](../database/index.md).

## Lifecycle Methods

### `afterAdd()`

Executed after the plugin is added, i.e., after [`pm.add()`](./plugin-manager.md#add).

### `beforeLoad()`

Executed during [`pm.load()`](./plugin-manager.md#load). Used to register events, initialize classes, or perform other preprocessing logic before plugin loading. At this stage, the core API can be accessed, but not other plugin APIs.

### `load()`

Loads the plugin and its related configurations. Executed during [`pm.load()`](./plugin-manager.md#load), after all [`beforeLoad()`](#beforeload) methods of plugins have finished execution. At this stage, other plugin APIs can be accessed.

### `install()`

Installation logic of the plugin, executed during application installation, upgrade, or when the plugin is first enabled. Typically used to perform tasks such as inserting preset data into tables.

### `beforeEnable()`

Executed before the plugin is enabled.

### `afterEnable()`

Executed after the plugin is enabled.

### `beforeDisable()`

Executed before the plugin is disabled.

### `afterDisable()`

Executed after the plugin is disabled.

### `beforeRemove()`

Executed before the plugin is removed.

### `afterRemove()`

Executed after the plugin is removed.


## Other Methods

### `t()`

Internationalization method.

### `createLogger()`

Creates a logger. Refer to [Logger](../logger.md).

### `toJSON()`

A method for internal use. Outputs plugin-related configuration information.

### `sendSyncMessage()`

Publish synchronization messages. The synchronization messages sent by this method will only be received by the same plugin on other nodes, and will not be related to other plugins.

#### Signature

```ts
sendSyncMessage(message: any): void | Promise<void>
```

#### Arguments

- `message`: Sync message data.

#### Example

```ts
this.sendSyncMessage({
  key: 'value'
});
```

### `handleSyncMessage()`

In a distributed environment, handle synchronization events published by the current plugin from other nodes. When the plugin uses memory state, it is necessary to override the event handling logic to ensure synchronization with the state of other nodes.

#### Signature

```
handleSyncMessage(message: any): void | Promise<void>
```

#### Arguments

- `message`: Sync message data from other nodes.

#### Example

```ts
handleSyncMessage(message: SyncMessage) {
  console.log('handleSyncMessage', message);
  // this.reloadData();
}
```
