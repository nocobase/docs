# Mobile

<PluginInfo name="mobile"></PluginInfo>

## Introduction

This plugin facilitates the configuration of mobile pages, leveraging a core framework built on Ant Design Mobile. It offers a variety of extension points and supports the integration of specific desktop blocks.

:::warning
The older `plugin-mobile-client` has been deprecated. Starting from version v1.3, it is recommended to transition to `plugin-mobile`. These two plugins are incompatible, so the new version will necessitate a complete reconfiguration of mobile settings.

## Installation

This plugin comes pre-installed but requires activation to function.
