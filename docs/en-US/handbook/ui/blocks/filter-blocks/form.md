### Setting Default Values for Fields

Like a normal [Form Block](/handbook/ui/blocks/data-blocks/form), you can set default values for normal fields and relationship fields. **When a field has a default value, a filtering operation will be automatically triggered at the first rendering of the page, so that the data block connected with it can display the matching data.**

## Configuration Operations

### Reset button

By default, clicking the "Reset" button will preserve the default values of the fields. If you want to clear the default values of the fields, you can open the configuration options and enable the "Clear Default Values" option.
