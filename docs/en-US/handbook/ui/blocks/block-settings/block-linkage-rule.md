# Block Linkage Rules

> **Note**: This feature is supported starting from version `v1.7.0-beta.xx`.

Block linkage rules allow users to dynamically control the visibility of blocks. For example, when a specific condition is met, a block can be hidden, enabling scenarios like **xxx**.

### Control Blocks with Global Variables
For example, "Current Role".

### Control Blocks with Contextual Variables
When a block can access the relevant records within the context, it can also control the block's visibility through contextual variables.
For example, "Current Record", "Current Form", "Current Popup Record", etc.

For more information on linkage rules, refer to [Linkage Rules](/handbook/ui/linkage-rule).
