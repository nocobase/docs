## Introduction

Form components, such as form blocks, detail blocks, and list blocks, support layout settings. The layout options include vertical layout (where labels and input fields are arranged in separate rows) and horizontal layout (where labels and input fields are placed side by side). This flexible layout choice can optimize the user experience based on specific needs, ensuring that information input is both clear and efficient.

### Vertical(default)

Subforms and subform (popup) also support layout configuration, with the default layout set to vertical.

### Horizontal

Horizontal layout places labels and input fields side by side, making better use of space.

The main form uses a vertical layout, while the subform uses a horizontal layout.
