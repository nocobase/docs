## What You See Is What You Get

NocoBase employs a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interface configuration mode. By clicking the UI Editor button, you can switch between the configuration mode and the usage mode.

## Configuration Items

Upon entering the interface configuration mode, orange configurable items will appear on the interface. Typically, the entry point for each configurable element's options is located at the top right corner of that element. Almost all elements can be configured and reviewed in real-time on the interface, with the following as some examples:
