### Supporting the creation of various data tables

- [General collection](/handbook/data-source-main/general-collection): built-in commonly used system fields;
- [Inheritance collection](/handbook/data-source-main/inheritance-collection): allows the creation of a parent table, from which child tables can be derived. Child tables will inherit the structure of the parent table, and can also define their own columns.

- [Calendar collection](/handbook/block-calendar/collection-calendar): for creating calendar-related event tables;
- [File collection](/handbook/file-manager/file-collection): for managing file storage;
- [Expression Collection](/handbook/workflow-dynamic-calculation/expression): for dynamic expression scenarios in workflows;
- [SQL Collection](/handbook/collection-sql): Not an actual database table, but quickly presenting the SQL query in a structured manner;
- [Database View collection](/handbook/collection-view): connects to an existing database view;
- [FDW collection](/handbook/collection-fdw): allows the database system to directly access and query data in external data sources, based on FDW technology;
