### Restore Backup

Supports restoring backups from the backup list or uploading local backup files to restore backups.
Restore operations are not allowed in the following scenarios:

- When the current NocoBase database is inconsistent with the following configurations in the backup file:
  - dialect
  - underscored
  - table prefix
  - schema
- When the `Tolerant mode` is not enabled, and the database version when creating the backup is higher than the current application database version.

> **Restore is a full database operation. It is recommended to back up the current database before restoring a backup.**

#### Restore from the backup list
