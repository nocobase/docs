If you want to embed NocoBase blocks in other websites or applications, user authentication is required, and the `token` needs to be appended to the link, for example `https://xxx.com/embed/qs087rz4o2b?token=xxx`. For detailed information about user authentication, please refer to [User Authentication](/handbook/auth).
