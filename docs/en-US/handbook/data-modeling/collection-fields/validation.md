# Field Validation
To ensure data accuracy,security and consistency in data tables, NocoBase provides field validation functionality. This feature consists of two main parts: rule configuration and validation rule apply.

## Rule Configuration
![20250819181342](https://nocobase-docs.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/20250819181342.png)

NocoBase system fields integrate [Joi](https://joi.dev/api/) rules, with support as follows:

### String
Joi string types correspond to the following NocoBase field types: single line text, long text, phone, email, URL, password, UUID.
#### Common Rules
- Min length
- Max length
- Length
- Pattern
- Required

#### Email

### Number
Joi number types correspond to the following NocoBase field types: integer, number, percentage.
#### Common Rules
- Greater than
- Less than
- Max value
- Min value
- Multiple

#### Integer
In addition to common rules, integer fields additionally support [integer validation](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.13.3#numberinteger) and [unsafe integer validation](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.13.3#numberunsafeenabled).

#### Number & Percent
In addition to common rules, number and percentage fields additionally support [precision validation](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.13.3#numberinteger).

### Date
Joi date types correspond to the following NocoBase field types: date (with timezone), date (without timezone), date only, Unix timestamp.

Supported validation rules:
- Greater than
- Less than
- Max value
- Min value
- Timestamp
- Required

### Association Fields
Association fields only support required validation. Note that required validation for association fields is currently not supported in sub-form or sub-table scenarios.

## Validation Rule Apply
After configuring field rules, the corresponding validation rules will be triggered when adding or modifying data.

Validation rules also apply to sub-table and sub-form components:

Note that in sub-form or sub-table scenarios, required validation for relationship fields does not take effect.

## Differences from Client-Side Field Validation
[Client-side field validation](/handbook/ui/fields/field-settings/validation-rules) and server-side field validation are applied in different scenarios, with significant differences in implementation and rule trigger timing, so they need to be managed separately.

### Configuration Method Differences
- **Client-side validation**: Configure rules in edit forms (as shown in the figure below)
- **Server-side field validation**: Set field rules in Data Source â†’ Collections Configuration

![20250819203845](https://nocobase-docs.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/20250819203845.png)


### Validation Trigger Timing Differences
- **Client-side validation**: Triggers validation in real-time as users fill in fields, displaying error messages immediately
- **Server-side field validation**: Validates on the server side before data entry after data submission, with error messages returned through API responses
- **Application scope**: Server-side field validation takes effect not only during form submission but also triggers in all scenarios involving data addition or modification, such as workflows and data imports
- **Error messages**: Client-side validation supports custom error messages, while server-side validation does not currently support custom error messages
