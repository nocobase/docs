# Release Management

## Introduction

In real-world applications, to ensure data security and application stability, multiple environments are typically deployed, such as a development environment, a pre-release environment, and a production environment. This document provides examples of two common no-code development processes and explains in detail how to implement release management in NocoBase.

## Installation

Three plugins are essential for release management. Please ensure all of the following plugins are activated.

### Environment Variables

- Built-in plugin, installed and activated by default.
- Provides centralized configuration and management of environment variables and keys, used for sensitive data storage, reusable configuration data, environment-based isolation, etc. ([View Documentation](environment-variables)).

### Backup Manager

- Available only in the Professional edition or higher ([Learn more](https://www.nocobase.com/en/commercial)).
- Supports backup and restoration, including scheduled backups, ensuring data security and quick recovery. ([View Documentation](/handbook/backups)).

### Migration Manager

- Available only in the Professional edition or higher ([Learn more](https://www.nocobase.com/en/commercial)).
- Used to migrate application configurations from one application environment to another ([View Documentation](/handbook/migration-manager)).

## Common No-Code Development Processes

### Single Development Environment, One-Way Release

This approach suits simple development processes. There is one development environment, one pre-release environment, and one production environment. Changes flow from the development environment to the pre-release environment and are finally deployed to the production environment. In this process, only the development environment can modify configurations—neither the pre-release nor the production environment allows modifications.

When configuring migration rules, select **“Overwrite”** for built-in tables in the core and plugins if needed; for all others, you can keep the default settings if there are no special requirements.

### Multiple Development Environments, Merged Release

This approach suits multi-person collaboration or complex projects. Several parallel development environments can be used independently, and all changes are merged into a single pre-release environment for testing and verification before being deployed to production. In this process, only the development environment can modify configurations—neither the pre-release nor the production environment allows modifications.

When configuring migration rules, select **“Insert or Update”** for built-in tables in the core and plugins if needed; for all others, you can keep the default settings if there are no special requirements.

## Rollback

Before executing a migration, the system automatically creates a backup of the current application. If the migration fails or the results are not as expected, you can roll back and restore via the [Backup Manager](/handbook/backups).
