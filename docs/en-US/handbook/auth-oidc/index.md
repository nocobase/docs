- HTTP - Whether the NocoBase callback address is http protocol, default is `https`.
- Port - The port of the NocoBase callback address, default is `443/80`
- State token - Used to verify the source of the request and prevent CSRF attacks. You can fill in a fixed value, **it is strongly recommended to leave it blank, a random value will be generated by default. If you want to use a fixed value, please assess your usage environment and security risks yourself.**
- Pass parameters in the authorization code grant exchange - When using the code to exchange the token, some IdPs may require passing the Client ID or Client Secret as a parameter, you can check and fill in the corresponding parameter name.
- Method to call the user info endpoint - The HTTP method when requesting to get user information API.
- Where to put the access token when calling the user info endpoint - The way to pass the access token when requesting to get user information API.
  - Header - Request header, default.
  - Body - Request body, used with `POST` method.
  - Query parameters - Request parameters, used with `GET` method.

### Usage

- Usage - The callback URL (Redirect URL) is used to copy and fill in the corresponding configuration in the IdP.

:::info
When testing locally, please use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`, because the OIDC login method needs to write the state to the client cookie for security verification. If the login window flashes by but does not log in successfully, please check whether there are unmatched state logs on the server and whether the request cookie contains the state parameter. This situation is usually due to the mismatch between the state in the client cookie and the state carried in the request.
