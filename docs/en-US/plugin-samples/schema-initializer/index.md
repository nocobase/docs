# SchemaInitializer

[SchemaInitializer](/development/client/ui-schema/initializer) is used to add various blocks, fields, and actions to the interface.

Depending on requirements, there may be the following extension scenarios:

- Adding sub-items to an existing Initializer
- Creating a new Initializer

Based on the above scenarios, we provide the following examples:

- [Adding a Simple Action](/plugin-samples/schema-initializer/action-simple)
- [Adding a Popup Action](/plugin-samples/schema-initializer/action-modal)
