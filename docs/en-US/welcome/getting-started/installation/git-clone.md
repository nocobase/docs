## 4. Set environment variables

The environment variables required by NocoBase are stored in the root `.env` file, modify the environment variables according to the actual situation, if you don't know how to change them, [click here for environment variables description](../env.md), or you can leave it as default.

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=postgres
DB_USER=nocobase
DB_PASSWORD=nocobase
```

:::warning

- `TZ` is used to set the application's time zone, with the default being the system's time zone;
- `APP_KEY` is the application's secret key, used for generating user tokens and so on (if APP_KEY is changed, the old tokens will also become invalid). It can be any random string. Please change it to your own secret key and ensure it is not disclosed to the public.
- `DB_*` is related to the database. If it is not the default database service in the example, please modify it according to the actual situation.
