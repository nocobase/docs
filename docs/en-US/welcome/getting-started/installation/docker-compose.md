# Docker (👍 Recommended)

## 0. Prerequisites

⚡⚡ Please make sure you have installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## 1. Download NocoBase

Download with Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nocobase/nocobase.git nocobase
```

## 2. Select database (choose one)

Change the directory to the folder downloaded in the first step.

```bash
# MacOS, Linux...
cd /your/path/nocobase
# Windows
cd C:\your\path\nocobase
```

The docker configuration of different databases is slightly different, please choose to switch to the corresponding directory.

### SQLite

```bash
cd docker/app-sqlite
```

### MySQL

```bash
cd docker/app-mysql
```

### MariaDB

```bash
cd docker/app-mariadb
```

### PostgreSQL

```bash
cd docker/app-postgres
```

## 3. Configure docker-compose.yml (optional)

<Alert>

Non-developers skip this step. If you know to how develop, you can also learn more about how to configure `docker-compose.yml`.

</Alert>

Directory structure (related to docker)

```bash
├── nocobase
  ├── docker
    ├── app-sqlite
      ├── storage
      ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── app-mariadb
      ├── storage
      ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── app-mysql
      ├── storage
      ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── app-postgres
      ├── storage
      ├── docker-compose.yml
```

Configuration notes for `docker-compose.yml`:

SQLite only has app service, PostgreSQL and MySQL will have corresponding postgres or mysql service, you can use the example database service or configure it yourself.

```yml
services:
  app:
  postgres:
  mysql:
  mariadb:
```

App port, the URL is `http://your-ip:13000/`

```yml
services:
  app:
    ports:
      - '13000:80'
```

NocoBase version ([click here for the latest version](https://hub.docker.com/r/nocobase/nocobase/tags)), a few important release notes:

- `nocobase/nocobase:main` Main branch version, non-stable version, can be used by users who want to try it.
- `nocobase/nocobase:latest` The latest version of the branch that has been released, if you are looking for stability, this is the one to use.
- `nocobase/nocobase:0.18.0-alpha.9` Use a specific version.

:::warning
`nocobase/nocobase:main` The arm64 architecture is currently not supported.
:::

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: nocobase/nocobase:latest
```

Environment variables

```yml
services.
  app.
    image: nocobase/nocobase:latest
    environment: APP_KEY=your-secret-key
      - APP_KEY=your-secret-key
      - DB_DIALECT=postgres
      - DB_HOST=postgres
      - DB_DATABASE=nocobase
      - DB_USER=nocobase
      - DB_PASSWORD=nocobase
```

:::warning
- `APP_KEY` is the application's secret key, used for generating user tokens and so on (if APP_KEY is changed, the old tokens will also become invalid). It can be any random string. Please change it to your own secret key and ensure it is not disclosed to the public.
- `DB_*` is related to the database. If it is not the default database service in the example, please modify it according to the actual situation.
- When using MySQL (or MariaDB), you need to configure the DB_TIMEZONE environment variable, such as `DB_TIMEZONE=+08:00`
