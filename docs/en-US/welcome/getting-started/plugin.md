## Installing and Updating Plugins via Command Line

:::warning
- Supports batch operations.
- This method is recommended if application updates cause plugin incompatibility or failure to start.
  :::

### 0. For Docker Versions, Enter the Container

```bash
docker-compose exec app bash
```

### 1. Log in to the NPM Registry

Configure the registry based on your setup.

```bash
npm login --registry=https://pkg.nocobase.com/
```

### 2. Add or Update Plugins

```bash
yarn pm add @nocobase/plugin-data-source-external-mysql @nocobase/plugin-embed --registry=https://pkg.nocobase.com/
```

### 3. Activate Plugins

```bash
yarn pm enable @nocobase/plugin-data-source-external-mysql @nocobase/plugin-embed
```

## Installing and Updating Plugins via Plugin Directory Upload

:::warning
- Supports batch operations and is convenient for migration.
- Suitable for servers in an intranet environment.
- Recommended for updating incompatible plugins caused by application updates.
  :::

### Add or Update Plugins

Store commercial and third-party plugins in the `./storage/plugins/` directory. You can download plugins in a development environment and upload them to the `./storage/plugins/` directory on the server. Alternatively, directly extract the plugin package into the directory. For example:

```bash
mkdir -p /my-nocobase/storage/plugins/@nocobase/plugin-auth-cas && \
  tar -xvzf /downloads/plugin-auth-cas-1.4.0.tgz \
  -C /my-nocobase/storage/plugins/@nocobase/plugin-auth-cas \
  --strip-components=1
```

This command ensures the plugin is extracted to `/my-nocobase/storage/plugins/@nocobase/plugin-auth-cas` without the `package` directory. The correct directory structure is as follows:

```plaintext
./plugin-auth-cas/dist/server/migrations/20240425200816-change-locale-module.js
./plugin-auth-cas/dist/server/auth.js
./plugin-auth-cas/client.js

### Run the Upgrade Command to Update Plugins

```bash
yarn nocobase upgrade
```
