## Improvements

### Improved "configuration actions" interaction

All actions are displayed in a single list in the dropdown menu, no longer distinguishing between "enabled actions" and "custom actions".

- Actions that can only be added once: These actions retain the switch effect, allowing users to only enable or disable them.
- Actions that can be added repeatedly: These actions no longer use the switch interaction and can be added multiple times.
- Merged similar actions
  - “Add new” and “Add record”
  - “Submit” and “Save record”

### Unified data format for workflow request node result:

```js
{
  config: {},
  headers: {},
  status: 500,
  statusText: 'xxx',
  data: {}
}
```

### Updated structure of the workflow user manual

## Fixes

### Log plugin now only shows logs of the current application

- In a multi-application environment, the log plugin only displays the log file list of the current application.
- The workflow and custom request folder paths are placed in the application folder.
